# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **Next.js**, **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **EmailJS**, and **Framer Motion**. It showcases my technical skills, work experience, education and projects crafted by me, and provides a way for visitors to get in touch with me.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and building the React app.
- **React.js**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
- **EmailJS**: To integrate email functionality for the contact form.
- **Framer Motion**: To add beautiful animations and page transitions.

## Pages

The website consists of the following pages:
- **Home**: Introduction and landing page.
- **About**: Information about myself, my education, my skills, my work experience, and my journey.
- **Portfolio**: A showcase of my projects.
- **Services**: A list of services I offer with details.
- **Contact**: A form for users to get in touch with me, integrated with EmailJS to send messages.

## Features
- **Page Transitions**: Smooth and interactive page transitions using Framer Motion.
- **On-load Animations**: Every page has an animated transition effect when loaded.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, thanks to Tailwind CSS, ensuring it works perfectly on all devices.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form that allows visitors to send me messages directly via email using **EmailJS**.

## Installation

To run the portfolio website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarvesh0906/Portfolio-Website
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your EmailJS account:
    - Create an EmailJS account at [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com).
    - Get your **user ID**, **service ID**, and **template ID** and configure them in your project.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
